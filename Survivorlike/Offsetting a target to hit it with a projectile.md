### Summary
To get the correct offset for the [[projectile]]'s target, first estimate the time to reach the target by getting the distance between the origin point and the arrival point and dividing that by the speed of the projectile. The offset will be the player's velocity multiplied by the time to hit the target. Make sure to also multiply by the [[PlayerVelocityAffectProjectile]] constant


### ðŸŽ¯ The Problem

Your bullet inherits some of the player's velocity when it's fired. So even though you're aiming at a target, the bullet might overshoot, undershoot, or drift depending on how the player was moving when they shot it.

### ðŸ§® The Solution: Predictive Offset

To ensure the bullet hits the **target position**, you need to **offset the target** in the opposite direction of the player's velocity. That way, when the bullet's velocity includes the player's movement, it ends up compensating for it and still hits the actual target.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### 1. **Define Your Variables**

Letâ€™s say:

- `targetPos` = position of the target in world space
    
- `playerVelocity` = the velocity of the player at the moment of firing
    
- `bulletSpeed` = the speed of the bullet relative to the player (how fast it moves independent of the player's movement)
    
- `bulletDirection` = the normalized direction vector from player to target
    

---

### 2. **Calculate Time to Target (Approximate)**

Estimate how long the bullet will take to get to the target:

```python
distance = (targetPos - playerPos).magnitude
timeToTarget = distance / bulletSpeed
```

---

### 3. **Offset the Target**

Since the playerâ€™s movement affects the bullet, offset the target **opposite** the player's velocity:

```python
offset = playerVelocity * timeToTarget
adjustedTarget = targetPos - offset
```

Now, aim the bullet at `adjustedTarget` instead of the original `targetPos`.

---

### 4. **Shoot the Bullet**

When firing:

```python
bulletDirection = (adjustedTarget - playerPos).normalized
finalBulletVelocity = bulletDirection * bulletSpeed + playerVelocity
```

This makes sure that the bulletâ€™s own speed is in the direction you intend, and the player's velocity is naturally added to itâ€”resulting in it landing at the original `targetPos`.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Tip

This works best if your bullet travels fast or the distance isnâ€™t huge. If your bullet is slow and the player is super fast, you might want to use more accurate prediction with simulation or iterative approximation. But for most cases, this method is quick and works really well.

There are four different inheritors for CollisionBody3D, those being the following:
* [[CharacterBody3D]]
* [[StaticBody3D]]
* [[PhysicalBone3D]]
* [[RigidBody3D]]

These are used when objects need to interact with the physics system or otherwise want to use various features of each child, such as velocity with [[MoveAndSlide]].
